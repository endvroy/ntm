# Neural Turing Machines
This is an implementation of the Neural Turing Machines in PyTorch. This implementation is updated to work with the newest version of PyTorch.

The model is in the `ntm` folder, while the tasks are in the `tasks` folder. Only the `copy` task and the `repeated copy` task is included. A new `copy with ending delimeter` task is added with the name `copy_2`.
